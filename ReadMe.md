   - pip package manager

2. **Install dependencies**

3. **Set up configuration**:
   - Create a `.env` file with your environment variables
   - Initialize your encrypted `config.json` using the ConfigManager

## Usage

### Basic Email Sending

```python
from email_system import ConfigManager, SecureEmailSender

# Initialize with your config
config_manager = ConfigManager('config.json', 'email_system.key')
email_sender = SecureEmailSender(config_manager)

# Send a simple email
email_sender.send_email(
    subject="Hello from Enterprise Email System",
    body="This is a test email sent securely.",
    recipient="recipient@example.com"
)
```

### Using Templates

```python
# With template (stored in templates/ directory)
email_sender.send_email(
    subject="Your Monthly Report",
    recipient="user@example.com",
    template_name="monthly_report.html",
    template_context={
        "username": "John Doe",
        "report_data": "..."
    }
)
```

### Scheduling Emails

```python
# Schedule an email for 2:30 PM
email_sender.schedule_email(
    subject="Reminder: Team Meeting",
    body="Don't forget our 3PM team meeting!",
    recipient="team@example.com",
    schedule_time="14:30"
)

# Run the scheduler
email_sender.run_scheduled_emails()
```

### Command Line Interface

Run the CLI interface:
```bash
python email_system.py --cli
```

## Configuration

The system uses an encrypted `config.json` file. Example structure:

```json
{
    "smtp_server": "smtp.example.com",
    "smtp_port": 587,
    "smtp_username": "your_username",
    "smtp_password": "your_password",
    "default_sender": "noreply@example.com",
    "smtp_ssl": true
}
```

To create your encrypted config:

1. Set a `CONFIG_PASSPHRASE` in your environment
2. Use the `ConfigManager` to encrypt your configuration

## Security Features

- Configuration encryption using Fernet (symmetric encryption)
- Email address validation with suspicious pattern detection
- Secure attachment handling with:
  - File size limits (25MB)
  - Allowed MIME type restrictions
  - Security headers
- Template variable sanitization against XSS
- TLS 1.2+ enforced for SMTP connections

## Logging

The system logs to both file (`email_system.log`) and console with timestamps and log levels.

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling throughout with:
- Validation checks at each step
- Clear error messages
- Graceful failure modes
